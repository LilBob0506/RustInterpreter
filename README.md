To build the interpreter:
```bash
cargo build
```
To use the interpreter in the command prompt simply run the below command in the lox directory
```bash
cargo run
```

To use your own test file, simply place the text file in the lox directory and run

```bash
cargo run -- yourfilehere.txt
```

if you want to run the test file for our text cases, the tests will automatically run with the below commmand from the lox directory
